    There are no gay rights in Popular Korea at the same time as there is no persecution! Gay rights are a necessity in the West as they are persecuted. People began to identify themselves as gay when there was a need to unite against a common oppression they suffered, due to sexual intercourse between people of the same gender.
    <br>
    <br>People's Korea is perhaps one of the least sexist nations in the world, so there is no persecution with 'femininity', which in the West is seen as something of gays and women. A report by a deserter says that he traveled by subway sitting on the lap of a friend once, this type of situation here in the West would be a reason for discrimination and even violence, but in Popular Korea it was treated as something normal, a gesture of companionship .
    <br>
    <br>There are no people who recognize themselves as 'gay' in Popular Korea, there are people of the same gender who, in their hearts, have sex. Why did not the individual who claimed to be 'gay' develop within Popular Korea itself, since this process has, over time, emerged in several countries in the West? Since People's Korea has never fought the homosexual relationship and has never encouraged a culture of stereotyping and discrimination of people under Western and Eastern sexist concepts, conflicting bases have not been created for people to recognize themselves as part of a distinct and oppressed group, which here we call the members of this group 'gay'. They are all North Korean citizens and their intimacy is a detail that does not interfere with their rights in the country or other aspects of daily life.
    <br>
    <br>The conclusion is that the two information we have about Popular Korea are true: There is no persecution of homosexual practices and at the same time that there are no gay rights, as it is not necessary.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br><i> Below is the statement by the Korean Labor Party on the homosexual issue:
    <br>«We, as a socialist country, embrace science and rationalism and recognize that many people are born with homosexuality as a genetic trait, something that can be innate or developed throughout their lives, and we defend that these people be treated with due respect. Homosexuals in the DPRK have never been subject to repression and persecution in any way, as is the case in many capitalist countries. However, as communists, we place great emphasis on morality and social harmony. In this way, we reject Western gay culture, which promotes consumerism, classism, the trivialization of human relationships, hedonism and promiscuity. »</i>
