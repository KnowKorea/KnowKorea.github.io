    On July 30, 1946, the 'Law of equal rights for men and women' of Popular Korea was enacted!
    <br>
    <br>For 36 years, Korean women have been subjected to incessant humiliation and cruel exploitation of Japanese imperialism. They had no political or economic rights and could not even participate in cultural, social and political life, besides being condemned to live in illiteracy.
    <br>
    <br>The liberation of Korea from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism has changed the social position of women. All the democratic reforms that took place in North Korea create conditions to emancipate women from previous political inequality, in the economy, in culture and in domestic life.
    <br>
    <br><i> With the purpose of eliminating the remnants of the policy of Japanese imperialism, reforms the old feudal relations between man and woman and giving women the possibility to participate in all spheres of cultural, social and political life, the Committee North Korea's Interim People decides:
    <br><b> Article 1: </b> Women enjoy equal rights as men in all spheres of state, economic, cultural, social and political life.
    <br><b> Article 2: </b> Women have the same rights as men to elect and to be elected in local bodies and to the supreme power.
    <br><b> Article 3: </b> Women have the same rights as men to work, wages, social security and education.
    <br><b> Article 4: </b> Women enjoy the right to free marriage as men. Forced marriage that takes place against freedom and without the consent of the parties is prohibited.
    <br><b> Article 5: </b> In the event that marital relationships deteriorate during life and there are reasons that prevent the relationship from continuing, women have the same rights as men to free divorce. The right of the mother to charge her ex-husband for a pension for her (young) children is recognized, and the divorce process and the regulation of the pension to be paid by the father are determined by the popular courts.
    <br><b> Article 6: </b> The age of marriage for women is 17 years of age and 18 for men.
    <br><b> Article 7: </b> Polygamy, an act of feudal-medieval relations and the practice of buying and selling wives in violation of their human rights, is prohibited. The system of prostitution with or without a license is prohibited, and that of 'courtesans' (women who sell themselves to a man as a sex slave in exchange for a life of luxury or favors). Those who break this article will be punished.
    <br><b> Article 8: </b> Women have the same rights as men, the rights to inherit well and land and, in the event of divorce, enjoy the right to share property and land.
    <br><b> Article 9: </b> From the moment the present Law is proclaimed, the laws and regulations of Japanese imperialism on the 'rights' of Korean women are declared null and void.
    <br>This Law comes into force from the first day of its proclamation. </i>
