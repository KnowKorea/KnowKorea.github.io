    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's elections are guided by the 1972 Socialist Constitution and are the ultimate expression of the popular power of its citizens.
    <br>
    <br>They are held every four to five years, following the standards defined by Chapter 90 of the Constitution, with their date usually defined at the beginning of the year to be held, through a resolution published by the Supreme People's Assembly. The date of the elections varies according to each season, but has always been held over the more than 7 decades of history of the People's Republic.
    <br>
    <br>What many do not understand is that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is based on <b> parliamentarism </b>, having the <b> Supreme People's Assembly </b> as a unicameral parliament. Thus, in elections, the population has the power to choose and approve their deputies, to be members of parliament, but not to appoint them to any office whatsoever. Appointment decisions are the responsibility of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, the highest organ of state power, which in turn is formed by internal elections of the members of the APS, comprising the President, Vice-Presidents, Secretary and members.
    <br>
    <br>Therefore, in the election years, a few months before the scheduled date for the people to attend the circumscriptions of their corresponding region, the <b> Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland </b> organizes local meetings to launch one or more candidates, who need considerable support from the local population.
    <br>
    <br><b> The requirements are: </b>
    <br>-Have nationality of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea;
    <br>-To be at least 17 years old;
    <br>-Don't have mental disability;
    <br>-Don't be serving time for committing a crime.
    <br>
    <br>The Constitution also guarantees the secret vote and universal suffrage. That is, regardless of sex, orientation and political position, religion, profession, among other points that can differentiate a group of people, voting is a citizen's duty. Everyone's vote, regardless of who they are, is highly regarded. Failure to appear on election day should be further clarified. In the case of people of advanced age and with weak health, it is not charged. Those who are abroad can cast their vote at the respective embassy or justify it, but it is customary for many to return during this period to vote in their residential district.
    <br>
    <br>The differential of the democratic and popular elections in Korea Juche is that in it, workers, peasants and other ordinary workers are elected and exercise their role in the People's Power without leaving their jobs. While in the capitalist society the ruling class controls the political sector, and when not, the members of the working class become bourgeois, in the Korean-style socialist society the popular masses have seized power and run the state, forming a single entity with the Leader , the maximum representative of the people.
    <br>
    <br>In every election we see miners, doctors, teachers, peasants, street cleaners, among others, being elected thanks to the confidence that the people have over them. There are also those who dedicate themselves exclusively to politics, however, under party guidance, they are always carrying out tasks for the benefit of the people, listening to their opinions and even helping them in their tasks.
    <br>
    <br>Unlike capitalist countries, in popular democracy in socialist Korea there is no parasitic political class. The position of politician for example is not as well paid as that of teacher and peasant, professions of great importance for any society.
    <br>
    <br>Another important point to note is that there are three political parties: the Labor Party of Korea, the Social Democratic Party of Korea and the Chondoista Party Chongu. All of them participate in the country's policy at all levels, however, according to the constitution, the PTC is responsible for carrying out all state activities, and both, despite their small differences, are guided by Ideia Juche.
    <br>
    <br>The Labor Party of Korea is the one with the greatest commitment to maintaining the legacy of the great leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, keeping Idea Juche as a premise and advancing the Korean revolution according to the developing reality. Since its foundation, the Social Democratic Party has defended the concepts of democracy, human rights, independence and anti-imperialism, being made up of peasants, Christians, artisans, middle businessmen and petty-bourgeois, and the Chondoís Chongu Party defends the Tonghak concept, that "Man and God are one", seeking the construction of a paradise on earth (as defended by religion, chondoism) and the liberation of the human being from all types of oppression; chondoístas had great participation in the peasant revolts during the feudal dynasty and the Japanese colonial period.
    <br>
    <br>In addition, candidates do not necessarily need to be affiliated with any party, and they can run as “individuals”. Over time, several candidates were elected in their locality as individual. Some of them were members of the Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and got fixed residency in the DPRK to apply, others of religious associations, others were simple workers who decided not to join any party, among other cases. This progressive and democratic option allows even those who do not agree with the central idea of ​​the State to stand as candidates and can give their opinions and points of view in the Popular Power if elected. This form of elections, in a society of monolithic ideology, defends the rights of the working class and the gains of the revolution, with the people deciding their future for themselves.
    <br>
    <br>The 1st session of the new legislature of the Supreme People's Assembly is always convened a while after the result of the elections and in it the deputies discuss relevant issues and vote among themselves to decide their respective positions. Any deputy can take up the position that he wants and that is accessible to the vote, not to those who are nominated by the Presidium of APS.
    <br>
    <br>The elections are always marked by a great popular participation and although the international bourgeois media makes a point of not understanding it and explaining it correctly to the public all over the world, making absurd accusations and ironies, there are always international observers from various parts of the world that accompany the entire electoral process and ensure that democracy is invariably respected.
    <br>
    <br>There are several constituencies across the country, which can be changed over the 5-year period due to specific factors in the region, such as population growth, moving to a more suitable location, or even the emergence of a new constituency to serve the demand. In addition, there are classifications for provinces, districts and counties, but also for cities that are under the direct control of the central government. We can mention the cities of Rason, Nampo and Kaesong as an example.
    <br>
    <br>Each constituency elects a deputy, or approves or fails him if he has only one candidate. In the last official announcement by the DPRK government, we had 687 constituencies, which may have some changes upwards or downwards in the elections to be held on March 10, 2019.
    <br>
    <br>In the 2014 parliamentary elections, the maximum leader Kim Jong Un was nominated as a candidate for deputy by the district of Paektusan, circumscription nº 111, a region where the majority is in the military or the son of a soldier, and was elected with 100% approval. Contrary to what was said in the media, he was elected in a district, that is, it is not abnormal to win in such a way, especially knowing his popularity among the locals.
    <br>
    <br>It is also important to note that a candidate can only be nominated by one constituency. In the event that more than one district wants a particular candidate, he must choose one of them.
    <br>

    <br>History
    <br>
    <br>The first democratic elections in the Korean Peninsula were held in November 1946, that is, just over a year after the liberation of Korea, in the then Provisional People's Committee of North Korea. However, the first official elections were in 1948, held in August, as they were the first DPRK elections that would be officially founded in September. It is also important because it has established the form of elections that continues today.
    <br>
    <br>In the 1948 parliamentary elections, the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland, composed at that time by social and political organizations, as well as political parties, from North and South Korea, was responsible for nominating candidates in their local meetings. to be submitted to the voters' favorable or contrary vote on election day. On this occasion as well, 360 South Korean candidates were elected and more than 70% of the South Korean population voted secretly despite the repression of US forces and their puppets.
    <br>
    <br>Since then, the FDRP has worked to organize elections at the province, district, county and city level within the 4-year period, while parliamentary elections are held every 5 years.

    <br>We must also pay attention to the fact that elections can be postponed if it is considered necessary, as occurred in 1953 (Korean War) and 1995 (natural disasters).
